  <h2><a href="#">Civic Platforms</a></h2>
  <p>Civic platforms provide ways to connect, follow, and engage with your representatives online</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkforYou</a></h3>
    <p>TheyWorkForYou lets you find out what your MP, MSP or MLA is doing in your name, read debates, written answers, see what’s coming up in Parliament, and sign up for email alerts when there’s past or future activity on someone or something you’re interested in.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <h3><a href="https://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a></h3>
    <p>  Do you know who your MP is? If your answer is ‘no’, you’re not alone – 78% of the UK population cannot name their representative in Parliament. If you need to make contact, that makes it a bit tricky – but WriteToThem solves this problem. Visit the homepage, input your postcode, and it will show you everyone who represents you, from your local councillors up to your MEPs. What’s more, you can then write them a message, simply and quickly.</p>
